# DS1054Z_screen_capture
'OscScreenGrabLAN.py' is a Python script that captures
whatever is displayed on the screen of a Rigol DS1000Z series oscilloscope.

It can save data as a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) picture of the oscilloscope screen,
 or as a text file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.

To achieve this, SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) are sent from the computer
to the oscilloscope, using the LXI (LAN-based eXtensions for Instrumentation) protocol over a Telnet connection.
The computer and the oscilloscope are connected together by a LAN (Local Area Network).
No USB (Universal Serial Bus), no VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture),
no IVI (Interchangeable Virtual Instrument) and no Rigol drivers are required.
Python 2 is required. Python 3 is not supported.

Tested with Windows 10, Python 2.7.12, pillow and Rigol DS1104Z (a fully upgraded DS1054Z oscilloscope).
Tested with Linux Ubuntu 16.04.1, Python 2.7.12 and pillow.
Tested with Mac OS 10.12.5, Python 2.7.12


User Manual:
-----------
This program captures either the waveform or the whole screen
    of a Rigol DS1000Z series oscilloscope, then save it on the computer
    as a CSV, PNG or BMP file with a timestamp in the file name.

    The program is using LXI protocol, so the computer
    must have LAN connection with the oscilloscope.
    USB and/or GPIB connections are not used by this software.

    No VISA, IVI or Rigol drivers are needed.
	
Installation:

    Installation on a clean Windows 10 machine
	    1. download and install Python 2.7.12 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

		3. download and unzip 'DS1054Z_screen_capture-master.zip' from https://github.com/RoGeorge/DS1054Z_screen_capture
		4. connect the oscilloscope to the LAN (in this example, the oscilloscope have fix IP=192.168.1.3)
		5. in the Command Prompt, change the directory (CD) to the path were 'OscScreenGrabLAN.py' was un-zipped
		    cd path_where_the_OscScreenGrabLAN.py_was_unzipped
		6. to run the OscScreenGrabLAN.py in the Command Prompt, type
		    python OscScreenGrabLAN.py png 192.168.1.3
